ðŸŽ® Project: Python Tkinter Tic-Tac-Toe (Player vs Player & Player vs Computer)

This project is a modern take on the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, built entirely in Python using the Tkinter library for GUI.
It features a clean, outlined 3Ã—3 game board drawn on a canvas, replacing the typical grid of buttons for a more authentic look.

Players can select their preferred mode at the start via a simple popup:

Player vs Player (PVP) â€” Two players take turns on the same screen.

Player vs Computer (PVC) â€” Play as "X" against a computer-controlled "O" that makes random moves.

Key Highlights:

Canvas-based outlined grid for a sleek, minimalist interface.

Dynamic X (blue) and O (red) rendering.

Win detection for rows, columns, and diagonals with green highlighting of the winning line.

Tie detection when the board fills with no winner.

Mode selection through clickable buttons (no manual input required).

Reset button to restart the game instantly and reselect mode.

Real-time status updates for turn indication and game results.

This project demonstrates Python GUI development, event handling, drawing operations, and simple AI logic â€” all packaged in a user-friendly mini-game.
